# Capstone Project 2: Bungie Public Opinion Analysis

This is the repository for my second capstone project: Public Opinion Twitter Analysis for Bungie and Destiny 2, part of my <a href='https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track-course/'>
  SpringBoard Data Science Career Track Bootcamp
</a> curriculum. The project is still in progress.

## About this project

The purpose of this project is to analyze the engagement metrics and sentiments of tweets made about the company Bungie and their hit game Destiny 2. I will also attempt to correlate these metrics and sentiments with those of the tweets made by the official Bungie (@Bungie) and Destiny (@DestinyTheGame) Twitter accounts. The goal is to see if there are trends among what makes popular tweets about Destiny 2 or Bungie, and to see what people think about the company and the game.
